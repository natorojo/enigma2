Encoding Definition:
- Cog order (eg 567)
- Code word (eg ZZZ)
- Step length (ie the number of letters to encode before jumping to the next definition)

Simple UI
- Input textarea for coding def as new line seperated triples


Requires Clarity:
- When changing arrangments of cogs do we:
	- start from the first cog when reading out
	- keep the output cog index the same when toggling between
	- should this be configurable? 
	- simply move outputCogIdx where inside the first loop or outside the first 
	loop :)
